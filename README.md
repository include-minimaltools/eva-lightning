<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The lack of tools with sufficient capacity to meet the needs of both students and teachers of the National University of Engineering in a satisfactory way, has led us to create a virtual learning environment platform with more recent web technologies such as React.js, Node.js, Aspnet, among others.

It has been observed both by us as students and other teachers that the current EVA platform is very useful for research and development of students. However, its loading times and other weaknesses of the design and integration with the National University of Engineering have led us to create a much lighter and faster platform when making screen changes.

These objectives have been achieved through the use of asynchronous loading of information, technologies offered by javascript languages, which is very difficult to implement in other languages for older web platforms, such as PHP. This is how the idea of creating:
